Html basic examples



HTML pages are text documents.

HTML uses tags, which are characters that si inside angled brackets.They act like containers and tell you something about the information that lies between them.

Tags are often referred to as elements.

Tags usually come in pairs. The opening tag denotes the start of a piece of content; the closing tag denotes the end.

Opening tags can carry attributes, which tell us more about the content of that element.

Attributes require a name and a value.

To learn HTML you need to know what tags are available for you to use, what they do, and where they can go.
